## Dataset and Resources

- **Dataset:** The GAN is trained on an anime character dataset, a collection of anime character images used to teach the GAN to create similar images.

- **Created By:** Sawan Kumar | April 2024

## Tasks in this Notebook

- Architecture of the GAN
- Loading and Preprocessing the Anime Character Dataset
- Defining the Generator and Discriminator Models
- Training the GAN
- Visualizing the Generated Anime Characters

## Setup

This project requires Python 3.7 or above. Install the necessary packages using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn tensorflow matplotlib
```

## GAN Configuration

- **image_size:** 64x64 pixels
- **latent_size:** 128
- **batch_size:** 128
- **epochs:** 25
- **learning_rate (lr):** 0.0002
